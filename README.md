# froggy - an endless frog frenzy

- made for the SoM Jam event by hackclub!

## how to play
> for a better experience download the macos release, but you can also play it on the web! at https://froggy-delta.vercel.app, it might take some time to load! 30 secs approx.

the game is simple you are a frog, and you eat mosquitoes! the game is endless so play till your hearts content! there are 3 types of mosquitoes - blue (slows you down), yellow - (speeds you up), and a red one
if you want to go to the next wave and dont want to eat a certain mosquito, you can use S to shoot it with a bullet! also when you eat a blue mosquito, you and your tongue slows down for 15 seconds, and vice versa for the yellow one!

## about the game
> the macos version is better, it has sfx and a better performance

the game is made purely in python and ported to the web using pygbag
i also tried to add screenshakes and other effects, which i think i held out pretty well!

## running the game from source

its simple, clone the repo, setup pygame and run ```main.py```!
